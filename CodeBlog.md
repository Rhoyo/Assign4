 * What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  How did you solve those problems?

 I initially had trouble as I had not used else if statements. Instead I just had if statements and then one final else to catch the unknown URLs. This somehow managed to mess up my css file from caching as well as the res.end() statements. However, I finally managed to find that my else statement was the problem. I changed it to an if statement with the parameters being not all of the valid URLs and eventually changed it to an else statements using else ifs above.

 * What did you learn from the assignment?  Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?

 I learned how to create a server without express. I never knew how to do it before so I had trouble rendering in my server at first, but then I realized that I had to keep node server.js running in order to keep my server up and load the pages.

* What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?

piazza was helpful and also the lectures were helpful, I feel that Robin really covered a lot of ground for this assignment. However, since the topics covered were brief this assignment felt a tad rushed, but none the less doable.

* What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?

I had to google nothing really. Initially I had googled things, but it turned out that the things I googled were irrelevant and really did not help with my project much. Instead the lecture notes turned out to be more useful.
